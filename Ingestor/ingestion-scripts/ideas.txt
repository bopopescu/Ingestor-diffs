Ideas that have not been implemented yet go in this file. Remove them as you implement them. 
Could also assign an idea to yourself if you plan on working on it in near future.

Check that primarycache is not off on any dataset, in general.
Check that secondary cache is not off on any dataset when the pool has L2ARC.
Make sure dump device is sized adequately.
Warn on sync=disabled on any dataset.
Warn on sync=standard or writeback cache off on zvols.
Warn on atime=on on datasets. (worth it?)
Implement functionality similar to volume-check to warn on non-redundant vdevs,
      dissimilar vdev layouts, unequal disk sizes and unequal models
Warn on excessive space usage of snapshots (threshold TBD)
Warn on checksum=off anywhere
Warn on compression=!off/zle if compressratio < 1.02
Warn on mountpoint of child datasets not matching mountpoint of parent
Warn on dedup=on and dedup ratio < 2x, make note of dedup=on.
Warn on low zfs used/avail ratio on the root of the pool
Warn on zfs_no_write_throttle=1 or non-zero zfs_write_limit_override
Warn on zfs_nocacheflush
Warn on any pools not ONLINE
Detect and warn on SUP-664
Warn on 3TB and larger drives in 2-way mirrors or raidz1
Warn on stale NMS locks (older than 1 day?)
